# Arduino LED Projects Code
_Code to support various Embedded system LED based projects I have built over the years_

## Introduction
I have built many LED based projects over the years in various forms and shapes. This repository contains the code for those projects. 
The code is written in C++ and is meant to be run on an ESP32 board. This code should be simpler and easier to understand, modify & run than previous versions of the code.
